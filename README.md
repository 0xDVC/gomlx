## üìñ About **_GoMLX_**
<img align="right" src="docs/gomlx_gopher.jpg" alt="GoMLX Gopher" width="220px"/>

**GoMLX** is a fast and easy-to-use set of Machine Learning and generic math libraries and tools. 
It can be seen as a **PyTorch/Jax/TensorFlow for Go**.

It uses just-in-time compilation to CPU and GPU (hopefully soon TPUs also) and is built on
top of [OpenXLA/PJRT](https://github.com/openxla/xla), which itself uses LLVM to JIT-compile code.
It's the same engine that powers Google's [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax) and 
[TensorFlow](https://tensorflow.org/), and it has the same speed in many cases.

<div>
<p>It was developed to be full-featured ML platform for Go, and to easily experiment with ML ideas -- see Long-Term Goals below.</p>

It strives to be **simple to read and reason about**, leading the user to a correct and transparent mental model 
of what is going on (no surprises) -- aligned with Go philosophy.
At the cost of more typing (more verbose) at times.

It is also incredibly flexible, and easy to extend and try non-conventional ideas: use it to experiment with new optimizer ideas, complex regularizers, funky multi-tasking, etc.

Documentation is kept up-to-date (if it is not well documented, it is as if the code is not there)
and error messages are useful and try to make it easy to solve issues.

**GoMLX is still under development, and should be considered experimental.**

## üó∫Ô∏è Overview

**GoMLX** has many important components of an ML framework in place, 
from the bottom to the top of the stack. But it is still only a slice of what a major ML library/framework should provide 
(like TensorFlow, Jax or PyTorch).

It includes:

* Examples: 
  * [Adult/Census model](https://gomlx.github.io/gomlx/notebooks/uci-adult.html); 
  * [Cifar-10 demo](https://gomlx.github.io/gomlx/notebooks/cifar.html); 
  * [Dogs & Cats classifier demo](https://gomlx.github.io/gomlx/notebooks/dogsvscats.html); 
  * [IMDB Movie Review demo](https://gomlx.github.io/gomlx/notebooks/imdb.html); 
  * [Diffusion model for Oxford Flowers 102 dataset (generates random flowers)](examples/oxfordflowers102/OxfordFlowers102_Diffusion.ipynb);
  * **(üöÄNew) LLM/GenAI**: See [GoMLX/Gemma](https://github.com/gomlx/gemma), a **GoMLX** implementation of 
    [Google DeepMind's Gemma v2 model](https://github.com/google-deepmind/gemma) ([blog post](https://ai.google.dev/gemma))
  * [GNN model for OGBN-MAG (experimental)](examples/ogbnmag/ogbn-mag.ipynb).
  * Last, a trivial [synthetic linear model](https://github.com/gomlx/gomlx/blob/main/examples/linear/linear.go), for those curious to see a barebones simple model.
* Pre-Trained models to use: InceptionV3 (image model) -- more to come.
* Docker with integrated JupyterLab and [GoNB](https://github.com/janpfeifer/gonb) (a Go kernel for Jupyter notebooks)
* Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation using [OpenXLA](https://github.com/openxla/xla) for CPUs and GPUs -- hopefully soon TPUs.
* Autograd: automatic differentiation -- only gradients for now, no jacobian.
* Context: automatic variable management for ML models.
* ML layers library with some of the most popular machine learning "layers": FFN layers,  
  activation functions, layer and batch normalization, convolutions, pooling, dropout, Multi-Head-Attention
  (for transformer layers), KAN (B-Splines, [GR-KAN/KAT networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10594), Discrete-KAN, PiecewiseLinear KAN),
  PiecewiseLinear (for calibration and normalization), various regularizations,
  FFT (reverse/differentiable), learnable rational functions (both for activations and [GR-KAN/KAT networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10594)) etc. 
* Training library, with some pretty-printing. Including plots for Jupyter notebook, using [GoNB, a Go Kernel](https://github.com/janpfeifer/gonb).
  * Also, various debugging tools: collecting values for particular nodes for plotting, simply logging  the value
    of nodes during training, stack-trace of the code where nodes are created.
* SGD and Adam (AdamW and Adamax) optimizers.
* Various losses and metrics.

## <a id="installation"></a>üõ†Ô∏è + ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

**TLDR;**: Two options: (1) [Use the Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/janpfeifer/gomlx_jupyterlab); 
(2) Pre-built for Linux (works in Windows WSL) or an experimental version for Apple/Metal: install 
[**gopjrt** (see installation instructions)](https://github.com/gomlx/gopjrt?#installing) 
(optional: [Nvidia's cuda support](https://github.com/gomlx/gopjrt?#installing)) or simply use the command(s) below. 
Depending on what data formats you use, you may want to install `hdf5-tools` programs (`sudo apt install hdf5-tools`).

For Linux (amd64), to install the XLA/PJRT engine (**goprjt**), run the following ([see source](https://github.com/gomlx/gopjrt/blob/main/cmd/install_linux_amd64.sh)):

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gomlx/gopjrt/main/cmd/install_linux_amd64.sh | bash
```

In addition, for Linux+CUDA (NVidia GPU) support, run the following ([see source](https://github.com/gomlx/gopjrt/blob/main/cmd/install_cuda.sh))

```bash
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gomlx/gopjrt/main/cmd/install_cuda.sh | bash
```


> [!Note]
> **NEW: Apple/Metal (arm64 only) VERY EXPERIMENTAL** support. It doesn't support every data type, nor all the operations, but many
> things work. I don't have an easily available Mac, but if you have any issues pls let me know. The XLA/PJRT driver
> (same as the one used by Jax) is [maintained by Apple here](https://developer.apple.com/metal/jax/).

**GoMLX** is mostly a normal Go library, but it depends on [**gopjrt**](https://github.com/gomlx/gopjrt), which
includes C wrappers to XLA (itself C++ code base). 
Installing **gopjrt** is relatively straight forward, follow
[the installation instructions](https://github.com/gomlx/gopjrt?#installing) 
(notice the optional Nvidia CUDA support, if you are interested).

Releases are for Linux/amd64 and experimental Mac only for now. 
They do work well with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in Windows.

### üê≥  [Pre-built Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/janpfeifer/gomlx_jupyterlab)

The easiest to start playing with it, it's just [pulling the docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/janpfeifer/gomlx_jupyterlab)
that includes **GoMLX** + [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/) + [GoNB](https://github.com/janpfeifer/gonb) (a Go kernel for Jupyter) and 
[Nvidia's CUDA runtime](https://hub.docker.com/layers/nvidia/cuda/11.8.0-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04/images/sha256-08aed54a213b52e9cb658760b6d985db2f4c5f7e8f11ac45ec66b5c746237823?context=explore)
(for optional support of GPU) pre-installed -- it is ~5Gb to download.

From a directory you want to make visible in Jupyter, do:
> For GPU support add the flag `--gpus all` to the `docker run` command bellow.

```bash
docker pull janpfeifer/gomlx_jupyterlab:latest
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 -v "${PWD}":/home/jupyter/work janpfeifer/gomlx_jupyterlab:latest
```

It will display a URL starting with `127.0.0.1:8888` in the terminal (it will include a secret token needed) that you can open in your browser.

You can open and interact with the tutorial from there, it is included in the docker under the directory `Projects/gomlx/examples/tutorial`.

More details on the [docker here](docker/jupyterlab/README.md).

## üß≠ Tutorial

See the [tutorial here](examples/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb). It covers a bit of everything. 

After that look at the demos in the [examples/](https://github.com/gomlx/gomlx/tree/main/examples) directory.

The library itself is well documented (pls open issues if something is missing), and the code is
not too hard to read. 
Godoc available in [pkg.go.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gomlx/gomlx).

Finally, feel free to ask questions: time allowing (when not in work) I'm always happy to help -- I created [groups.google.com/g/gomlx-discuss](https://groups.google.com/g/gomlx-discuss), or use [GitHub discussions page](https://github.com/gomlx/gomlx/discussions).

## üéØ Long-term Goals

1. Building and training models in Go -- as opposed to Python (or some other language) -- with focus on:
   - Being simple to read and reason about, leading the user to a correct and transparent mental
     model of what is going on. Even if that means being more verbose when writing.
   - Clean, separable APIs: individual APIs should be self-contained and decoupled where possible.
   - Composability: Any component should be replaceable, so they can be customized and experimented.
     That means sometimes more coding (there is not one magic train object that does everything),
     but it makes it clear what is happening, and it's easy to replace parts with a third party
     versions or something custom.
   - Up-to-date documentation: if the documentation is not there or if it's badly written, it's as 
     if the code was not there either.
   - Clear and actionable error reporting
2. To be a productive research and educational platform to experiment with new ML ideas and learn.
   - Support mirrored training on multiple devices and various forms of distributed training (model and/or data
     parallelism) in particular to support for large language models and similarly large model training.
3. To be a robust and reliable platform for production. Some sub-goals:
   - Support modern accelerator hardware like TPUs and GPUs.
   - Multiple backends, e.g:  llamacpp, WebNN (with Wasm), pure Go version, etc.
   - Import pre-trained models from [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) -- maybe using ONNX -- and allow fine-tuning.
   - Compile models to binary as in C-libraries and/or WebAssembly, to be linked and consumed (inference) anywhere
     (any language).

## ü§ù Collaborating

The project is looking forward contributions for anyone interested. Many parts are not yet set 
in stone, so there is plenty of space for improvements and re-designs for those interested
and with good experience in Go, Machine Learning and APIs in general. See the [TODO file](docs/TODO.md)
for inspiration.

No governance guidelines have been established yet.
