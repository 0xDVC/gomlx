# UI Library

This directory contains various UI related packages that should be considered "extras" and never linked
directory by GoMLX.

They are here for convenience for the users (easy to find) and the developers (easier than maintaining many
different repositories). 

There are strictly no dependencies from GoMLX proper (`backends`, `graph`, `ml` and `types` directories) to
the `ui` sub-packages. 

The `examples` directory also serve as example for the `ui` sub-packages, and will have dependencies to the `ui`
directory.
